# 8 Week SQL Challenge

Welcome to the 8 Week SQL Challenge, a learning-by-doing journey to build strong SQL skills via real-world–style case studies.

## 🎯 Purpose

The 8 Week SQL Challenge is designed to help data learners and aspiring analysts:

* Practice SQL through **hands-on, realistic case studies**
* Build a **project portfolio**
* Gain comfort with core SQL techniques and workflows, to be better prepared for data-analysis or data-engineering roles. 
## 📚 What’s Included

The Challenge consists of **8 case studies** (as of now), each representing a different scenario where you can apply SQL to answer meaningful business/data questions.
